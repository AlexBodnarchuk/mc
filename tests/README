Overview
--------

This tree contains unit tests.

To enable these tests, run 'configure' with '--enable-tests'. You need to
have the "Check" unit testing framework[1] installed.[2] You should then
see "Unit tests: yes" in configure's summary message.

To compile the tests, run 'make check'.


Tips and tricks
---------------

* To be able to step with the debugger into test code, see [3]. E.g., do:

    $ export CK_FORK=no
